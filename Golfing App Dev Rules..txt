Golfing App Dev Rules.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Folder Structure:
/project-root
  /index.html             # Main landing page
  /styles.css             # Main stylesheet for the app
  /scripts.js             # Main JavaScript file for frontend logic
  /firebase-config.js     # Firebase configuration file (for authentication and database)
  /assets/                # Folder for any images, icons, etc.
    /images/              # Any image files (e.g., logos, background images)
    /icons/               # Any icons used in the app (e.g., social media, buttons)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frontend Technologies:

HTML for structuring the content.

CSS for styling the page using one main stylesheet (styles.css) for consistency across all pages.

JavaScript for functionality using one main JavaScript file (scripts.js) to manage dynamic interactions across all pages.

Real-time Updates:

Use Firebase Realtime Database to store and sync score data in real-time.

Use onSnapshot to listen for changes in the Firebase database and dynamically update the leaderboard.

Score Submission (JotForm Integration):

Embed or link a JotForm form for golfers to submit their scores.

Use JotFormâ€™s webhook feature to send the score data to Firebase upon submission.

User Authentication:

Implement Firebase Authentication for user registration, login, and logout.

Ensure that only authenticated users can submit scores and interact with the leaderboard.

Security Rules:

Firebase Realtime Database rules will be set to ensure only authenticated users can submit scores and access the leaderboard.

Use Firebase rules like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "rules": {
    "leaderboard": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      ".write": "auth != null"
    }
  }
}
Deployment:

Host the website using Firebase Hosting, Netlify, or Vercel for free.

Ensure proper deployment setup with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) if needed.

Folder Structure Consistency:

Maintain the folder structure as outlined. Any additions or changes will be documented to ensure organization.

The folder structure is as follows:

bash
Copy
Edit
/project-root
  /index.html
  /styles.css
  /scripts.js
  /firebase-config.js
  /assets/
    /images/
    /icons/
Responsiveness:

The website must be responsive, ensuring that the content adapts to all screen sizes and devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Use CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styling of the website based on the screen width.

The layout, text, images, and leaderboard will resize appropriately to fit the device being used.

Tracking Updates & Changes:

Every new feature, change, or removal will be recorded and tracked to ensure consistency.

I will maintain a log of updates so that no decision or change is lost in the process.

Key Notes:
One styles.css file will handle all the styling for the website across all pages.

One scripts.js file will be used to handle all JavaScript functionality, including Firebase interactions, real-time updates, form submissions, etc.

The website will be fully responsive by using CSS media queries to ensure it looks good on all devices.
